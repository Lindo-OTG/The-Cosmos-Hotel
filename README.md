# The-Cosmos-Hotel
Hotel management Desktop App.

a bit of context:
We were tasked to create a windows form hotel management app, linked to a sql database, to keep track of bookings in a hotel.
The customer had to be added to the database, be able to view avialable rooms, make a booking, get notifications etc...

# Project Startup
* Restore Database .Bak file or use Entity framework to create an image of the database in your SQL Server
* Change the connection string property in the app.config file and datahandler file (change the data source) to your database connection string
* Build the Project
* Navigate to the Bin folder, and execute the .exe file

# Disclaimer
For all intents and purposes the project was considered complete, but it is always open for improvement, further development and refactoring to the latest coding standards.

if you cannot run the project using the application.exe, you can open it via visual studio to view the source code and forms.
the backup database is attached, if you know how SQL server works you can edit the dataholder to change the server name to, 
your Sql Server.

even if you do manage to run the project i still suggest you open the source code to get a grasp of my coding and logic.
